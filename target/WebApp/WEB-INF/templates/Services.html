                                            <h4>Diagnostics</h4>
                                            <p>The modern lives we lead are fraught with a number of traps that make us 
                                            ignore the most important machine we live with everyday; our bodies. It becomes
                                             very easy to remain in the traps that prevent us from entering a state of mind 
                                             where we feel happy about how our bodies feel on the outside and on the inside. 
                                             We find that most people don’t think of their body as something that should be 
                                             in the best possible condition they can keep it.</p>
                                             <p>The biggest modern risk we have is sedentary lifestyle. It takes us away from
                                              being active on our feet. To cope for the energy imbalance in our bodies, we end 
                                              up eating food that is unhealthy for us. There could be many other causes for 
                                              illnesses to develop which should be checked for regularly. Very little is 
                                              understood about the value of getting yourself a physical check up but the ultimate
                                               help given to the patient is in the form of early diagnoses of preventable diseases
                                                which help all our patients to live fuller lives.</p>
											<p>This is where we at Astra Diagnostics can help with services ranging from a 
											specific health checkup to a complete health checkup. We understand that people are 
											not ready to admit when something is going wrong in their body. People want to ignore
											 their health and fight it on their own until something is seriously wrong. By that
											  time, it could be too late and patients regret missing a chance to get a preventive
											   health checkup.</p>

                                              there was scope to improve on the current model of pharmacies by offering 
                                              additional services and professionalism to benefit the customer experience.

											 medical details to our confidential database, and provide you with monthly or 
											 fortnightly delivery of all your household medicinal needs - without ever having

                                                <p>Pre-employment check-ups are required to cover occupational and safety hazards 
                                                at workplace and ensure that the selected candidate is medically fit for the job. – e.g.: 
                                                a person with TB in a call center, a cook with typhoid in a restaurant, an asthmatic as 
                                                an AC mechanic or a color blind person in a clothing store, etc</p>
												<h4>What do they consist of?</h4>
												<p>Complete Medical / Physical Examination</p>
												<p>Laboratory Investigations</p>
												<p>Complete Blood Count (26 parameters) </p>
												<p>Blood Sugar Fasting</p>
												<p>Urine Routine, Microscopy</p>
												<p>Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) </p>
												<p>Blood Group , Rh Factor</p>
												<p>X-RAY Chest</p>
												<p>Optional Tests</p>
												<p>ECG</p>
												<p>HIV (For AIDS) </p>
												<p>SGPT (For Liver) </p>
												<p>Cholesterol (Heart) </p>
												<p>HBsAg (Hepatitis) </p>
												<p>Creatinine (Kidney) </p>
												<h4>Why Pre employment checkups? </h4>
												<h5>Safety </h5>
												<p>New applicant should be free from medical conditions that could result in sudden 
												incapacitation that can lead to an accident, especially, for health and safety sensitive 
												jobs. Examples of such jobs are driving, piloting, etc. </p>
												<h5>Health</h5>
												<p>Pre-employment is a means to establish baseline health data against which future health 
												status of the employee be compared. It is also a means of identifying existing medical 
												conditions, including contagious diseases which could be adversely affected by occupational 
												exposures. </p>
												<h5>Productivity and Efficiency</h5>
												<p>Pre-employment medical examination is the means by which employers can satisfy 
												themselves that new recruits are free from medical conditions which can affect the productivity 
												of the new recruits once they are employed. </p>
												<h5>Cost</h5>
												<p>The cost of medical treatment is escalating. Employers who provide coverage on medical care 
												especially the ones, who provide full, unlimited coverage, are concerned on this. They are not 
												willing to employ job applicants who suffer from medical conditions that have high medical cost 
												potential. It is a good practice if measures are taken at protecting co-workers as well as the 
												public from becoming infected through direct contact with an infected food handler or by means 
												of contaminated food handled by such a person. </p>
												<h4>Other pre-employment Check Ups</h4>
												<p>Lists of test to be done in persons with open sores, ulcers, pustules: </p>
												<p>PUS Culture</p>
												<p>Nasal Swabs</p>
												<p>Other diseases that need to be checked prior to employment and later at 6 months interval are: </p>
												<p>Chest and respiratory diseases like TB which could pose a hazard to co-workers</p>
												<p>Blood-Borne Infections like HIV, Hepatitis B</p>
												<p>Returning to work after an illness</p>
												<p>In most cases of infection, bacteria and viruses can still be found in someone’s feces after 
												symptoms stop. It is therefore important that managers continue to exclude food handlers for a 
												period of time after this. 48 hours is the recommended length of time. </p>
												<p>Extra care should be taken over personal hygiene practices on return to work though, especially hand washing. </p>
												<p>Lists of test to be done in case of person returning from a diarrhea illness: </p>
												<p>Stool Routine</p>
												<p>Stool Culture (3 consecutive stool samples taken 48 hours apart in case of cholera, 
												typhoid and dysentery should be tested negative)
												Widal Test</p>

                                            <h4>Second Opinion</h4>

                                            <p>A second medical opinion becomes highly resourceful when you are faced with a critical 
                                            health situation or life changing medical decision regarding your treatment options.</p>
											<p>You may not have access to highly specialized doctors where you live or have paucity 
											of time or restrictions on travel due to your condition. These limitations can be easily 
											overcome by remote medical opinion services where the physicians work with you remotely 
											to provide recommendations about your treatment plans or options.</p>
											<p>Surveys have indicated that getting a second (or rarely even a third) opinion from 
											different doctor/specialist is critical to identifying the right type of treatment or 
											investigation. There have been numerous cases where a second opinion has contributed in 
											significantly amending the treatment recommended.</p>
											<h5>When do you need a Second Medical Opinion:</h5>
											<p>Confusion on the choice of treatment.</p>
											<p>About to undergo a major surgery. .</p>
											<p>The health condition is further deteriorating with current treatment. .</p>
											<p>The treatment is too risky given the medical condition and age. .</p>
											<p>May not have access to good healthcare facilities, doctors/physicians. .</p>
